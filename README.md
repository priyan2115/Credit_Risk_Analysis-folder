# Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis: 
### Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, we’ll oversample the data using the **RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms**, and **undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm**. Then, we’ll use a combinatorial approach of over and undersampling using the **SMOTEENN algorithm**. Next, we’ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, **BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier**, to predict credit risk. Once we done, we’ll evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

# Results: 
### Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

# Summary: 
### Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.There is a summary of the results.There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification
